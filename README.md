# Surfs Up - Weather Analysis for Hawaiian Surf Shop

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of our analysis was to create a business case for the opening of a combination surf and ice cream shop on the island of Oahu. We have a possible business partner that needs reassurance that Oahu is a suitable place for this shop. In addition, we have saved our code for future use if our posisble business partner would like to explore other data or islands.

## Results:
Looking at the temperatures for both June and December, the following three items were in our favor:
  1. The average June temperature is approx. 75 degrees, while the average December temperature is not far off at 71 degrees.
  2. The minimum June temperature was 64 degrees, while the minimum December temperature was 56 degrees. 
  3. The maximum June temperature was 85 degrees, while the maximum December temperature was 83 degrees.
  
## Summary:
Based on the information we have gathered, we can see that Oahu would be an excellent place to open a surf/ice cream shop since the temperatures are so consistent over the course of the year. Before presenting to investors, we may want to look further into preciptation, especially focusing on if it occurs during a certain time of day. This can inform our most ideal operating hours. I also recommend looking into wind speeds month over month, as those impact surfing conditions and may show when we can expect the most surfing related traffic in our shop.
